# Results

The results of the two experiments will be stored in this folder. 

The sub-folder *Experiment_1* will stored videos of the learned 2D test embeddings 
over the epochs, and it will be created when the code (or notebook) of the experiment is launched for the first time. 

The sub-folder *Experiment_2* contains pre-computed results of experiment 2. If you want to analyze these results, you can launc the notebook or 
experiment file with the option/variable *study_hyperparams* set to *False*.
